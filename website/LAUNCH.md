# Launch Plan: skills.crafter.run

## The Hook

"We curate the best agent skills so you don't have to dig through skills.sh"

## Launch Venues

### Hacker News (Primary)
**Title**: "Show HN: Skills – Curated agent skills for Claude Code, Cursor, and more"

**Post**:
```
We built a curated directory of agent skills that actually work.

skills.sh has 200+ skills, but it's hard to know which ones are worth
installing. We're solving that by handpicking the best skills and providing
clear documentation.

Right now we have 1 skill featured (intent-layer for context engineering),
with more coming weekly. Each skill is:
- Battle-tested in production
- Well-documented with examples
- Compatible with 10+ agents
- Actively maintained

Built by Crafter Station, the non-profit behind Peru's biggest AI hackathon.

Open source: https://github.com/crafter-station/skills
Live site: https://skills.crafter.run

We'd love feedback on:
- Which skills should we curate next?
- What would make this more useful?
- Feature ideas for v2

skills.sh is great, but it's hard to know which skills are actually good.

So I built skills.crafter.run - a curated directory where we only feature
skills that are battle-tested, well-documented, and actively maintained.

Starting with 1 skill (intent-layer for context engineering), adding more
weekly. All open source.

🔥 Launching skills.crafter.run

A curated directory of agent skills for @ClaudeAI Code, @cursor_ai,
@github Copilot, and 10+ more agents

Why? skills.sh has 200+ skills but it's impossible to know which ones
actually work. We fix that. 🧵

1/ We handpick skills that are:
- Battle-tested in production codebases
- Well-documented with real examples
- Compatible with multiple agents
- Actively maintained by real teams

2/ Starting with intent-layer from @crafterstation - a context engineering
skill that helps agents navigate codebases like senior engineers

Uses hierarchical AGENTS.md files. 1.5k+ installs.

3/ Coming soon:
- 10+ more curated skills
- Publisher pages (Vercel, Clerk, Anthropic)
- Skill combos ("The Auth Stack", "The RAG Stack")
- Community submissions

4/ Why we built this:

We run Peru's biggest AI hackathon and see devs waste time testing bad
skills. This solves that.

Open source. No BS. Just good tools.

### LinkedIn

**Post**:
```
After reviewing 200+ agent skills for our hackathons, we noticed a problem:

Most skills on skills.sh are untested, poorly documented, or abandoned.

So we built skills.crafter.run - a curated directory of only the best
agent skills.

Each skill is:
✓ Battle-tested in production
✓ Well-documented with examples
✓ Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and more
✓ Actively maintained

Starting with 1 skill, adding more weekly. All open source.

Built by Crafter Station, the team behind Peru's biggest AI hackathon
(300+ participants, backed by Vercel, Clerk, and Anthropic).
